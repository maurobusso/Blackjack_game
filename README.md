This project was started by building the core function of the game, which is a conditional statement, checking what is the sum of the card in the hand of the player and giving a response accordingly. This was first tried with hard coded value then the function in charge of randomize the card was implemented. 

#

Optimizations: 

Further optimization could included a better UI and the use of an API to display image of the card that are been drawn. Furthermore, a log in feature with a fake betting system will also help improve the game experience.

Lessons Learned: 

Thanks to this project I was able to improve and put into practice: array manipulation, Boolean, conditionals, objects. The easy way to create randomization with the Math. method.
