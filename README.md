The project began with the development of the core game function, which calculated the sum of the cards in the player's hand and responded accordingly. Initially, hard-coded values were used, and later, randomization of cards was implemented. The project underwent refactoring to improve the design's responsiveness and enhance code readability.

Optimizations were introduced, including the use of Tailwind.css for a responsive design and the integration of a deck of card API to display card images. The project was then migrated to TypeScript, enhancing type safety and code maintainability.

Lessons Learned: 

This project proved to be a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply and improve my skills in array manipulation, conditionals, and object-oriented programming. The usage of Math methods facilitated easy card randomization, while CSS enabled the integration of a responsive design.

Through this project, I honed my proficiency in front-end web development, including DOM manipulation and data fetching from external APIs using the Fetch API. The game's interactive buttons, dynamic card rendering, and chip updates based on wins and losses were achieved through an organized and modular development approach, utilizing TypeScript modules to handle shared variables efficiently. The code adheres to best practices for readability and maintainability.

TypeScript proved to be a powerful tool, providing static typing and advanced features that improved code safety. The use of union types for variables handling potential null values and explicit object type annotations further enhanced code reliability. Type assertion was employed to ensure proper string conversion when updating DOM elements.

Overall, this project showcases the successful integration of TypeScript into front-end development, resulting in a robust and enjoyable browser-based Blackjack game.
