# Blackjack game

This is a one player blackjack game. It was initially built as a part of a module on the "Learn JavaScript" course from the Scrimba. But later been changed and improved with the use of the "Deck of Card" API for displaying the card images.

It was first started by writing the core function of the game, which checks what is the sum of the card in the hand of the player and give a response accordingly. This was first tried with hard coded value then the function in charge of randomize the card was implemented. Some refactoring has been done from the original version, such as: </br>
</br>-Different design.
</br>-Added a more responsive design.
</br>-Improvement in code redability and some comments added to explain some of the code.
